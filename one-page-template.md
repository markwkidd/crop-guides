# One-Pager Template
Copy and paste the raw markdown source for this template page, and replace the placeholder text.

## Introduction
A couple sentences of basic introduction to this species.  

## Planting seeds
When to plant? How closely?
Feel free to add or edit this: Grow them as you normally would, but resist using any kind of insecticides or fungicides, even if they are organic (natural, genetic tolerance of stressors cannot be discovered if artificial means are employed to keep plants alive).  

## Isolation Distance Requirements
If somebody has a variety they want to keep separate

## Selection Criteria
Try to be as general as possible. Our seed pledge says save seeds from the earliest, tastiest, and healthiest plants.  What we want now is a good diversity, and plenty of seeds to share and then grow out again. Each year the resilience to local climate, bugs, and diseases will improve. If you have a bounty, choose seeds from the earliest, tastiest, and healthiest plants. 

## Processing and Cleaning Seeds
Add the relevant info from the Dry or Wet or fermentation process here. 

## Drying and Storage

## Footer
Each printed page will have the website and QR code for more info.
