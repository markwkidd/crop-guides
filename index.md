## About this Project
Crop Wiki is a collaborative effort to compile guides on landrace seed-saving for cultivated crops. The initial goal is to write a set of one-pagers for the most common crops that can be printed and distributed in-person at seed-saving community events. In the future, this content may be transferred into an actual “wiki” website that has more advanced information, links to other articles, multimedia content (images, video), etc.

The one-pager guides should be accessible to an audience of new and beginning seed-savers who may show up to events in person or request seeds from Going to Seed’s Shopify store with no prior knowledge of landrace gardening or the course materials. That means the guides need to be sufficiently detailed about the full growing and harvest process, yet not so technical as to intimidate the non-gardener.
