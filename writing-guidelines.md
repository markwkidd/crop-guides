# Writing Guidelines
* Each page should be able to function as a standalone, printed document available at a local seed event. 
  - Could be a collaborative seed saving project with neighbors seeds mixed (not from our Seed program), but associated with us and similar practices. 
  - OR think Seed Library or other seed organization that got a bunch of seeds from our program and is displaying them in a seed library for gardeners to pick up. 
* No hyperlinks to other info. Include information for the entire season.  Assume the reader has little to no seed-saving knowledge and has not read Landrace Gardening or taken the course.
  - When basic info is done, we will use these to create online pages including links, recipes, or anything else, and link to the online store or anywhere else from the website or the course.
  - Then seed savers will be directed to send seeds back to GTS main project. 
* For examples of mostly-complete pages, check out Melons, Cucumbers, Common and Runner Beans, Moschata.  If you’re the steward of any of those, please edit as you see fit! I was just practicing. Sometimes the order of things makes sense to reverse depending on which order selection and seed saving happens.
* Especially if it’s a new mix w /multiple species, somewhat unusual, think of a gardener landing on the Shopify seed page from a random place, buying a packet of seeds, best of intentions but no landrace or seed knowledge... New Seed Saver. What do they want to know about planting the mix with seed saving in mind? How should they select, save and process the mixes so that we will want those seeds back and the project will grow and seeds will get more resilient and diverse?
* Since we can’t use links to our online content, use the “Seed-Saving Instruction Templates” below to start off the seed-saving instructions in your one-pager. Some crops may need customizing further. 
* Edit the document directly if you’re the steward of the crop, or use the comments features to suggest edits on other crop pages.
* Try to keep each species to a page.
