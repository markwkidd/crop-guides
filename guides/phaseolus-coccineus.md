# Beans, Common - Phaseolus Coccineus

## Introduction
Runner beans are a popular bean type known for their beautiful flowers as well as their edible pods and dry beans. They are a different species from common beans and from pole beans.  They were originally domesticated in Southern Mexico, and have a moderate crossing rate of about 20% (much higher than bush beans). 
These packets contain a diverse mix of genetics. You can add your own varieties into the mix, but avoid commercial hybrids (labeled F1 in seed catalogs) to avoid introducing undesirable traits into the population.

## Planting seeds
Plant seeds directly into the garden when soil temperatures are consistently above 45°F. Grow them as you normally would, but resist using any kind of insecticides or fungicides, even if they are organic  – natural, genetic tolerance of stressors cannot be discovered if artificial means are employed to keep plants alive.    Each year the resilience to local climate, bugs, and diseases will improve. These plants are climbers, so plant them with corn or sunflowers, or provide a trellis.

## Isolation Distance Requirements
If somebody has a variety they want to keep separate

## Selection Criteria
Selection Criteria:   Look for the healthiest and most productive plants during the growing season. Mark those plants with a ribbon, and try not to eat too many from  those plants as green beans!  Especially in the first year, your goal is to increase the seed supply so that you can have more to eat in the future.   For the remainder of your harvest, mix all the beans together, save some for yourself,  give seeds back to your community, or contribute to the Going to Seed project, goingtoseed.org

## Processing and Cleaning Seeds
Where possible, allow the pods to mature fully on the plant and begin to dry down into a crispy state. Another option (especially if a frost or heavy rain is imminent) is to pull out the whole plant withits seed pods and hang the plant to dry. As the plant dies, the seeds continue to mature and gain strength.

## Drying and Storage
Harvest pods and finish drying the beans -- on a screen in a dry shady place, or in a dehydrator. A seed, when struck with a hammer should disintegrate and be dry through, not smash into a patty.   
Once very dry, freeze the seeds in an airtight container (glass jar or tightly sealed plastic) for 48 hours to kill any pests. When removing them from the freezer, allow the container to come to room temperature before opening, to prevent condensation from rehydrating seeds.
