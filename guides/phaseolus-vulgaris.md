# Beans, Common - Phaseolus Vulgaris

## Introduction
Common beans include many varieties we cook as green beans and dry beans, like kidney, navy, and black beans. This bean mix is selected for being vigorous and early with more plants that cross-pollinate. There are many colors and textures that end up in the dry bean mix. When making soup, some of the beans cook more quickly, leading to varied textured dishes and a deep flavor.  These beans are hardy, productive, and early (up to a month earlier than heirlooms). 
These packets contain a diverse mix of genetics. You can add your own varieties into the mix, but avoid commercial hybrids (labeled F1 in seed catalogs) to avoid introducing undesirable traits into the population. 

## Planting seeds
Plant seeds directly into the garden when soil temperatures are consistently above 45°F. Plant a bean every 2-3” and thin weaker plants to end up with 6” spacing. Grow them as you normally would, but resist using any kind of insecticides or fungicides, even if they are organic (natural, genetic tolerance of stressors cannot be discovered if artificial means are employed to keep plants alive).    Each year the resilience to local climate, bugs, and diseases will improve.   

## Isolation Distance Requirements
If somebody has a variety they want to keep separate

## Selection Criteria
Selection: By saving a portion of your entire dry bean harvest, you will naturally be moving towards plants that are happier and more productive in your area.   Always save plenty of seeds so that you can plant thickly, and thin as necessary. 
Harvest pods and finish drying the beans -- on a screen, in the shade, in a dehydrator. A seed, when struck with a hammer should disintegrate and be dry through, not smash into a patty.   

## Processing and Cleaning Seeds
Where possible, allow the pods to mature fully on the plant and begin to dry down into a crispy state.   Another option (especially if a frost or heavy rain is imminent) is to pull out the whole plant with its seed pods and hang the plant to dry. As the plant dies, the seeds continue to mature and gain strength.

## Drying and Storage
Once very dry, freeze the seeds in an airtight container (glass jar or tightly sealed plastic) for 48 hours to kill any pests. When removing them from the freezer, allow the container to come to room temperature before opening, to prevent condensation from rehydrating seeds.
